# React + CSS Modules Task — Overview

This project is a simple UI built with React and CSS Modules, focusing on modular styling, form handling, validation, and navigation between pages.

## Key Concepts Used

Components: Components like Navbar, ContactForm, and App.jsx Page were created to structure the app.

CSS Modules: Styles were scoped locally to each component, avoiding conflicts and keeping the design consistent.

Form Handling: Controlled inputs were used to manage form values, with validation logic applied to ensure correct user input.

Validation: Regex and conditional checks were implemented to prevent invalid names, emails, and empty fields.

Routing: React Router DOM was used to navigate between pages smoothly, creating a multi-page experience inside a single-page app.

State Management: React state hooks (`useState`) were applied more extensively to track form values, validation errors, and UI changes.

Rendering with State: Learned how re-rendering works when state changes, and how to optimize updates for better performance.

## Technologies

React, CSS Modules, JavaScript, React Router DOM

## What I Learned

- Working with CSS Modules to keep styles modular and conflict-free.  
- Handling forms in React, controlling input values, and applying validation rules.  
- Navigating between pages using React Router DOM.  
- Applying state management more deeply to control UI behavior.  
- Understanding how React re-renders components when state changes, and how to use that knowledge to build responsive, dynamic UIs.
